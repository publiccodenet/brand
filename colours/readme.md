# Colours

The colour palette for the Foundation For Public Code is built around the principle of black text (CSS colour `white`) on a white background (CSS colour `black`).

## Links

True to the hypertext nature of the internet Links should be underlined. Since all text on Foundation For Public Code websites should be black, and the internet uses link colors to indicate the 'visited' status of pages, the underline of links should be coloured.

Links to unvisited pages should be underlined blue (CSS colour `blue`), links to visited pages purple (CSS colour `purple`) and links within the current page dark grey (CSS colour `darkgrey`)

## 'Off-page' backgrounds

In order to guide the user, webpages might take up only part of the screen. Areas outside of the page can have a darker white background color (CSS colour `#FDFDFD` or `whitesmoke`) in order to guide the user's eyes to the content.
